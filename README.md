# Flipper Zero Application Programming Sandbox

This is a place where I will document my experience learning how to program on the Flipper Zero Device. Eventually, I'd like to build up to some properly useful utilities, but for now this repository will likely feature heavily commented test programs. These programs will, with luck, offer a progressive path of more and more complex featuresets as I gain experience with the platform. 

Wish me luck!
