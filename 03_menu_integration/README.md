# Menu Integration

This code will build on the "Menu Test" code to hook the menu up to a couple of other views, each demonstrating a different view module. 

## Goals
* Implement actual callbacks for the test menu
* Make option one link to a Dialog object, which will be filled out with text. 
* Make option two link to a File Browser
    * I'd like the file browser to return the path selected and report to the user somehow.
